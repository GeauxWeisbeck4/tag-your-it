# [TAG YOUR IT!]()

Tagging the comment section of other developer's websites and asking that they return the favor.I want to see if we can create the largest game of tag ever attempted while also helping open up new networks and projects for developers, artists, and entrepreneurs. It is optional of course and you can always remove my comment, but this could be a reeally cool experiment to see how many people we can connect through this repository.

This is attempting to be somewhat similar to [Webmentions]()
, [Indiehackers], and [WebRing], [CSS Zen Garden], and [Style Stage Live]

I've completed these projects and have instructions in the repository if you would like to expand your network through this grassroots networking/marketing experiment. The data will be open to everyone as an opensource project and you can access a large DB of other Developers.

## How to Participate

(1) When you are tagged, fork this repository and from anybody else who is "playing tag"
(2) When you fork the project, I will share your project and social media info on mutltiple platforms (at least Disqus, GitHub, and Twitter for now)
(3) Share the project to your social netowrk and encourage others to partake in #tag-your-it
(4) Make sure you keep all of the code from the first line to the end of this line on your README.md.
(5) Customized your README.md and the rest of the package with something that you would want to share with this whole network. Maybe you want them Buy You Coffee and You can share that button or maybe you want to show off the prettiest component in the world - go wild!
